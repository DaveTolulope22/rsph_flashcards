            {question: 'What is the primary function of the respiratory system?', answer: 'The primary function of the respiratory system is to facilitate gas exchange, specifically the intake of oxygen (O2) and the release of carbon dioxide (CO2).'},
            {question: 'What are the main structures of the upper respiratory tract?', answer: 'The main structures of the upper respiratory tract include the nose, mouth, pharynx, and larynx.'},
            {question: 'What are the main structures of the lower respiratory tract?', answer: 'The main structures of the lower respiratory tract include the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.'},
            {question: 'What is tidal volume?', answer: 'Tidal volume is the amount of air inhaled or exhaled during a normal, resting breath.'},
            {question: 'What is the alveolar-capillary membrane?', answer: 'The alveolar-capillary membrane is the thin barrier between the alveoli and the blood capillaries, where gas exchange occurs.'},
            {question: 'How is oxygen transported in the blood?', answer: 'Oxygen is primarily transported in the blood by binding to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells.'},
            {question: 'What factors drive gas exchange in the alveoli?', answer: 'Gas exchange in the alveoli is driven by the partial pressure differences of O2 and CO2 between the alveolar air and the blood.'},
            {question: 'Where are the respiratory centers located?', answer: 'The respiratory centers are located in the brainstem, specifically in the pons and medulla.'},
            {question: 'What role do chemoreceptors play in controlling respiration?', answer: 'Chemoreceptors detect changes in blood oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH levels, providing input to the respiratory centers to adjust breathing accordingly.'},
            {question: 'What role do chemoreceptors play in controlling respiration?', answer: 'Chemoreceptors detect changes in blood oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH levels, providing input to the respiratory centers to adjust breathing accordingly.'},
            {question: 'What are some common respiratory disorders?', answer: 'Some common respiratory disorders include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory infections.'}
